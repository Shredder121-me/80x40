                                              Fantasy for a fortnight. Two weeks
                                               To think and read here in a small
                                                   Swiss town called Leysin. The
                                         Busy Life palled and covered in a pall.
                                                                                
                                           Sunna's pink covers everything as the
                                   Sun is setting beneath the alps and its light
                                           Rays scatter their own interpretation
                                          Of the world and everything in it red.
                                                                                
                                                Warmth and the late Swiss spring
                                                  Bring channeling of inside and
                                            upside down thinking and imagination
                                                to anyone with time for thought.
                                                                                
                                          Dreams and dream-scape of every color,
                                               Scent, sound and anything bent on
                                                Freedom for these fourteen days.
